# Introduction 

This project is a simple multi-class classification problem using supervised learning.  The objective is to design a neural network to categorize shape.  The 3 claases of shape are circle, triangle and rectangle.  Each input data record is a sparse set of coordinates (5 in this case) on the perimeters of one of these shape.  Note that these shapes are concentric which is centered around (0,0).  This simplication makes the training process and the size of the NN reasonably smaller. 

# Sample data 

A few examples of data is illustrated below.

# The design

Three sets of training data are generated by randomly picking the location on the perimeter of the chosen shape. These training data (labelled) are concatenated and a simple feed foward fully mesh NN is training.  We used a simple multiple class F1 metircs are used as measurement of the performance (including macro-averaging and micro-averaging)

Reference to such F1 scoring can be found [here](https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/multiclass-metric.html)
